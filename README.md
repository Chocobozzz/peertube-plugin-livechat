# PeerTube plugin livechat * ALPHA VERSION *

Work In Progress

Plugin that allows to integrated an iframe with an external webchat application.

This is under development. It is not functional yet.

For now, there is no documentation for how you can setup the webchat.
It has to be setup by your own. For example with a XMPP Server and the ConverseJS Javascript.

Next step: document how you can setup the XMPP server.
